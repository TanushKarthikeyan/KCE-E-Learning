                    <h3>Learn Web Development in the Easiest Way</h3>
                    <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                    The new digital e-learning content formats are a challenge for educational work. The range of media for electronic learning (e-learning) is considerable. The learning performance can be surprisingly high, however, providing new education media satisfies the needs and learning preferences of the learners. Today more and more people use digital media, such as computers, tablets and smartphones. They use these not only to obtain information, but also to educate themselves voluntarily and in a self-determined fashion.Also, in advanced and university training these new digital learning formats are indispensable. Companies rely specifically on e-learning content formats for product and software training or security instructions. Universities likewise provide their lecture materials online. Among the top 500 German companies, more than two-thirds train their employees utilizing e-learning content. By now, even a number of technophobe e-learners are open to digital learning. The clear advantage: learning on demand via the internet makes advanced training more flexible. That is why some companies, who encourage employees to take responsibility for their own learning, even provide permanent external and mobile access to learning materials for employees. This saves resources, time and potential travel costs. However, the works council must be included in these considerations.

A typical e-learning content format is computer-based training (CBT). Computer-aided learning using multimedia learning programs and learning software has been around since the 1980s. The emphasis with this kind of multimedia learning is on self-study independent of fixed hours and locations.

                    Game-based learning is, according to experts like Henry Jenkins, the most effective learning technology of the 21st century. Game-based learning allows players to acquire new knowledge using a digital game. How does that work? Usually gamers play voluntarily and for leisure alone. Learning effects are not the primary objective of games. They occur as side effects. This is because learning takes place alongside gameplay.Game-based learning utilizes the fun factor of games for educational purposes. Serious games playfully impart serious learning content. With game-based learning, the learning objectives are elaborately integrated into the game’s world. Gamification, by contrast, integrates short, game-typical elements into an, in essence, game-unrelated context. Both kinds of knowledge transfer are expected to increase the learner’s motivation and intrinsically improve the learning process.The triumph of micro content began in the digital marketing sector. Advertisers have long since utilized small, attractive bits of information and micro moments. They call attention to new products and incite the recipient to a positive interaction. Media pedagogues and coaches now make use of these experiences in the context of education. By use of micro learning, they decrease employee reservation towards new learning processes. This is confirmed by a study conducted by the economics faculty of the University of Hanover regarding the user acceptance of ubiquitous learning systems. The study showed the majority of users prefer a maximum of ten tasks. Complex computer-aided learning programs in the e-learning content format are not always the best choice. Sometimes smaller bits of education suffice. For instance, when explaining new features of a machine to employees or implementing a new sales routine. Micro media and micro content formats consist of small building blocks
